        <h1>Welcome to <b>Stripes Interiors LLC</b></h1>
        <article>
            <h2>The Vision</h2>
            <p>
                Our journey begun with a vision:
                Truth serves life, and so technology serves beauty.
                
                Every nation and empire across history thrived, and every social and cultural evolution was initiated, not on money but on that which moves the emotions; on beautiful ideas and ideals---
                It is owing to millennia of collaboration to build the most astounding works of beauty that Europe had become the cradle of civilization, is the most visited continent in the world, and is priceless to the global economy. 
                
                Why is this so? Because in a world that runs on emotions, the most powerful economic force is trust, the most creative people are the most empowered, the most successful companies are those that answer their 'why'---because people don't buy what you do, they buy why you do it; they don't suffer for money, but for ideas and ideals that are beautiful.
                
                Therefore, by constantly reminding individuals and firms of what they stand for and so who they are, beautifully presented principles multiply productivity within companies, regions, and lives; it thus raises civilization to a new level.
                
                We're not just another construction firm, but an architect of developed nations; our vision is a unifying project that is conducted under the eye of centuries, and is not restricted to only Quarterly reports or mere competition.
                
                We contribute to this collective vision by collaborating with our clients on a one-to-one basis to identify their specific corporate principles, and thus to create modern bespoke and beautiful environments that bespeak the client's brand principles.
                
                â€œIt is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances." - Oscar Wilde
