        <h1>Welcome to <b>Stripes Interiors LLC</b></h1>
        <article>
            <h2>The Vision</h2>
            <p>
                Our journey begun with a vision:

                <blockquote id="motto"><i>Truth serves life, so technology, beauty.</i></blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>
               Every nation and empire across history thrived, and every social and cultural evolution was initiated, not on money but on that which moves the emotions; on beautiful ideas and ideals---
               It is owing to millennia of collaboration to build the most astounding works of beauty that Europe had become the cradle of civilization, is the most visited continent in the world, and is priceless to the global economy. 
            </p>
            <p>
               Why is this so? Because in a world that runs on emotions, ideas influence all---because people don't buy what you do, they buy why you do it; because they don't suffer for money, but for ideas and ideals that they find beautiful. Thus, man does not live by bread alone.
            </p>
            <p>
               Therefore, by constantly reminding individuals and firms of what they stand for and so who they are, aesthetically beautiful principles help raise civilization to a new level of modernity. 
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <i>“He alone is modem who is fully conscious of the present”</i> (Jung)
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                We say ‘modern’ and ‘futuristic’; we mean conscious. We do not waste time trying to imagine what a future would be like; instead, we consciously make it by learning from history and from nature.
            </p>
            <p>
                We emphasize the past in order to hold the scales against our break with tradition. For us, "today” stands between “yesterday” and "tomorrow”, and forms a link between past and future. After all, the really modern is often to be found among those who call themselves ‘old-fashioned’.
            </p>
        </article>
        
        <article>
            <h2>Our Craft</h2>
            <p>
                In nature, there are no straight lines. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When it comes to what things look like, the Western world and modern design is obsessed by perfection, by symmetry and ideal proportion, by invincibility, by stability, by youth, flawlessness… while the aesthetics of the Orient languish. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Our design philosophy is to harmonize this imbalance and to transcend the limits of expression to allow our clients to most fully express their brand principles.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
               “It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances." - Oscar Wilde
